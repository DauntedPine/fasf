Type faster by not lifting your fingers off the keyboard - a concept. 

## Into 

Out WPM is affected by the fact that we have to lift our fingers off the keyboard. What if we could have our hands in the 'base' position for 5 finger typing and still be able to write comprehensible sentences? 

## How to use

clone the repo, run `python fast-type.py` and have your hands in the default 5 finger typing position; instead of lifting the finger to press a letter, press down on the key that is under the finger you would've used to write the original character.

For example, instead of pressing `w`, you will hold your hand still and press `s` which is the finger you would have used to press `w`. The idea is that the longer the words the less likely there will be a collision. Using a word prediction model like ChatGPT would help solve this issue: 

## Example 

```
jskjf a slfd ;fddkdfklj jlddl sljld jdl; sllfd fjks kssjd
```

would output :

```
Most likeley : using a word prediction model would help solve this issue
Raw output: using a/q/z word prediction model would help solve this issue
